## Overview

This repository contains a Django tutorial project directory, 'Mysite'. There is one app in the project, named 'Polls'. The Django tutorial was completed up to and including part 05:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/

This repository is planned to be integrated into Chrisxkeith's repository of the same name.

## Tools Dependencies and Installation Instructions:

### Python3

Download and install Python 3 for your platform:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

	Python 3.7 was used during the Django tutorial.

### Set up your virtual environment

__Note:__ The pyvenv script has been deprecated as of Python 3.6 in favor of using python3 -m venv to help prevent any potential confusion as to which Python interpreter a virtual environment will be based on.

Virtual environments are typically created on each user's PC and are not added to source control.

Issue this command _outside of_ any local repository directory, so that your new virtual environment won't be added to source control:

    python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
	
### Install Additional Python packages

__Note:__ pip is the preferred package installer program for Python. Starting with Python 3.4, it is included by default with the Python binary installers.
